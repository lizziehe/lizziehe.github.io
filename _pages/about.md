I am a year-1 Ph.D at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), supervised by Prof. Li Sheng ([LLB lab](https://hkpullblab.wixsite.com/home)). Prior to that, I received my MA in Language Data Science and Applications from Shanghai International Studies University and BA in English (Linguistics) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research is about the computational mechanisms (e.g., rule generalization, distributional analysis, predictive processing) underlying typical/atypical language development, with specific focus on Chinese syntax/semantics and Mandarin-speaking children.
